												<td width="250" class="tbltext" valign="top">The Pine Mountain Ski Slide is one of the tallest artificial ski jumps in the world. It's a really big slope and a really big slide. Every February jumpers come from all over the world to jump off the Pine Mountain ski slide. 
<br><br>
You have to climb up to the top of the slide and carry your skis. The jump looks like a slide but you are standing up on skis. You go down the slide fast and jump off and fly like a bird. It's hard when you land and you have to stop before you get to the end. 
<br><br>
Lots of people come to see the jumps. You can walk around or sit in the car if it's really cold. People bring food and grills and eat hamburgers and hot dogs and beans and veggies. Some people buy food at the big tent. <br><br><br>

Last year it was very very cold. Masahiko Harada from Japan tied the North American hill record of 459 feet. He jumped almost to the bottom of the hill. Everyone honked car horns or rang cow bells. It was lots of fun.

<br><br>
In the summer you can go to the top of the hill. You see lots of stuff. It's like you're on top of the world.
