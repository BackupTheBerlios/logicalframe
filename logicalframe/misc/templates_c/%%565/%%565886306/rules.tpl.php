    <b>Jumps</b><br>
	Skiers take two jumps in the individual events. The distance and style points for each jump are added together to give the total score. The athlete with the highest score after the two rounds wins.<br><br> 
	In the team competition, the four skiers representing a country each take two jumps. The eight jumps are added together, and the team with the highest total score wins.<br><br>
	<b>Scoring</b>
	<br><br>
	<b>Style Points</b><br>
	Skiers can receive a maximum of 60 style points. If competitors fall on the in run, they get zero points. Judges consider the three groups of the jumper's movements: flight, landing and outrun. <br><br>
During the flight, jumpers must make a bold and aggressive move at takeoff, proceed rapidly and smoothly to achieve an optimal flight position and initiate preparations for the landing. Judges evaluate the jumper's utilization of air pressure and whether or not the jumper's legs are fully stretched. They can deduct up to 5 points, including 2.5 points for unsuccessful utilization of air pressure. <br><br>
When landing, jumpers must come from a stable flight position, split their legs and bend their knees right before touching down and then increase the distance between the legs while bending the back leg (telemark position). Judges look for a smooth movement from the flight position to the landing. They can deduct up to 5 points, including 2 points for failing to achieve a telemark landing. <br><br>
During the outrun, skiers need to remain in the telemark position until the fall line (for about 10 meters to 15 meters), maintaining a relaxed body position and keeping the two skis parallel. Judges look for jumpers to distribute their weight equally on both legs. They can deduct up to 7 points, including .5 to 3 points for unsteadiness, 5 points for the hands or body touching the snow prior to the fall line and 7 points for a fall before crossing the fall line. <br><br>
<b>Distance Points</b><br>
Distance is measured from the edge of the takeoff to the jumper's landing place. The landing point is the place where the jumper's feet touch the slope. The skis must be in full and flat contact with the slope. For skiers landing in the telemark position, the distance is the midpoint between the feet. <br><br>
Competitors receive distance points based on the slope's K point (critical point). The K point is where the hill flattens out; top jumpers routinely soar past it. The K point is 90 meters for the individual normal hill and 120 meters for the individual and team large hill. A jump to the K point is worth 60 points, and each meter greater than or less than that distance increases or decreases the score by 2 points for the normal hill and 1.8 points for the large hill. <br>
The style and distance points are added together for the total score. <br><br>
<b>Ties</b><br>
If two or more jumpers have the same score, they are considered tied.
